                  IMPORTANT: Artefy NFTs contain animations which are enabled by
                  our proprietary technology. If you purchase an Artefy NFT the
                  3-dimensional aspect associated with it will only display when
                  the NFT is within Artefy. If you withdraw an Artefy NFT to an
                  external wallet and remove it from the Platform, you will
                  still enjoy the art associated with Artefy NFT but it will
                  simply display as a 2 -dimensional animated art piece.
