      "answer": "Many creatives (musicians, artists, photographers & more)  struggle to make money from their work. This is because it is so easy to reproduce works online with no need to pay or even credit the original artist. By working directly with the creators and using blockchain technology, Artefy is able to ensure that every copy of an artist’s work is legitimate, and that the artist will directly profit from every sale, including 2nd hand sales on our marketplace. We also give artists an opportunity to grow their networks (and customers) through our extensive communities of fans opening up new revenue streams for creators globally. "

    },
    {
      "question": "What are drops?",
      "answer": "Whenever we launch a new limited edition NFT or digital collectible, it’s known as a “drop.” We’ll usually have a time and date for these in advance. Sometimes, a drop will be announced at short notice and you won’t want to miss it. Make sure you follow our social channels for any big announcements. Drops will often contain multiple NFTs from different artists. There are two different sale options, Auctions, where the NFT goes to the highest bidder or Direct Sale where there is a set price, first in, best dressed. "
    },
    {
      "question": "What are crates?",
      "answer": "Crates are the cheapest, fastest and most exciting way to build your digital collection. Each crate set is a themed collection of works from different artists. These have been carefully curated by the artefy team and put together into a crate set. When you open a crate you randomly receive a selection of NFTs from that collection. Crates contain either 5, 10 or 20 NFTs depending on their cost. These NFTs are then added to your wallet and you can either display them in your gallery or list them for sale on the Artefy marketplace. Once all the crates in that collection have been opened then that’s it they are sold. From that point you will have to check the marketplace to complete your collection. "
    },
    {
      "question": "How does the marketplace work?",
      "answer": "Once you have an NFT, you can choose to list it for sale on the Artefy marketplace. Here you can either set a sale price or put it up for auction to the highest bidder. "
    },
    {
      "question": "What are collections?",
      "answer": "Collections are different themed sets of NFTs. Complete collections to unlock exclusive platform rewards. Each NFT is only part of one collection. All editions of that NFT are in the same collection. It does not matter which edition of an NFT you own to complete a collection. "
    },
    {
      "question": "What are editions?",
      "answer": "The edition number is how many versions of that collectible exist. 1 of 1 edition means that only one of that NFT will ever be made, 1 of 100 means that there are only 100 of that NFT. The smaller the edition number the rarer the NFT which often means higher prices. Creating multiple editions allows more than one person to own that piece in the same manner that many artists will do a limited run of some of their most popular prints."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is rarity?",
      "answer": "The rarity of an NFT is determined by the number of editions. It is an easy way for collectors to understand how exclusive an NFT is. The rarity levels are as follows"

There are 5 different gallery themes you can choose from, with many more being added in the future. You can choose how your collection is displayed, select from an ever growing collection of different frames, sizes and layouts.

    {
      "question": "What does (non) fungible mean?",
      "answer": "If something is non-fungible it means it is unique, and can not be directly replaced by anything else. Money is a fungible asset, one $2 coin can be swapped for any other $2 coin. Artwork (or music or trading cards) are non-fungible, one painting can not be swapped for another even if they are created by the same artist."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is an NFT/ digital collectable?",
      "answer": "An NFT or Non-Fungible Token is a digital asset that represents objects like art, music, in-game items and videos. Each unique Artefy NFT is stored on the blockchain, so whenever you buy one rest assured that it’s a 100% official licensed collectable from your favourite artist or creator. Each NFT has its own unique identifying code that can never be changed which means that ownership and rarity are fully verifiable. Over time there will be 1000’s of NFTs (or digital collectables) on Artefy and each will have its own complete history authenticity stored in the code."

      "question": "What is blockchain?",

This gives Blockchain technology several key features that give authority and security to digital collecting:"
    },
    {
      "question": "What is a wallet?",
      "answer": "A wallet is where you access your digital currency and assets. There are 100s of different wallets both online and there are also hardware versions. When you set up your Artefy account you have the choice of connecting to your existing MetaMask wallet or we can create a new Artefy wallet for you. "
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know the art is real/ authentic/ approved by the artist?",
      "answer": "Unlike many other NFT platforms, Artefy does not allow anyone to upload their own creations onto the Artefy platform. We work closely with the artists or their representatives to ensure every NFT on our platform is part of that artist’s vision for their work.  With the Artefy brand on an NFT, you can be guaranteed these are 100% authentic digital limited editions, endorsed by the creator."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is to stop Artefy making more copies?",
      "answer": "All Artefy digital collectables are special limited editions. By setting the edition number into the uneditable blockchain you will always know how many editions of an NFT will ever exist. "
    },
    {
      "question": "How do I know my collection will be safe and secure?",
      "answer": "It’s vitally important to protect your Artefy wallet like you would any personal accounts online. NFTs that you own on your Artefy Wallet are all managed by you so keep your passwords safe and don’t share them with anyone."
    },
    {
      "question": "I’ve bought an NFT, but what do I actually own?",
      "answer": "You're buying a limited edition digital creation, designed and approved by the creator, verifiable on the blockchain. Basically you are buying the right to use, distribute and display the creation for non-commercial purposes. Since you own this unique creation, you can also re-sell the same non-commercial use rights, to the creation, on the secondary marketplace."
    },
    {
      "question": "How does an artist benefit from joining Artefy?",
      "answer": "In addition to opening up artists to a huge global community of new fans (and buyers) blockchain technology also means that the artists will profit from all future sales as long as they are sold on the Artefy marketplace. A commission of all future sales go back to the original artist meaning that should an artist’s work become more desirable (and valuable) over time (as is normally the case) they will see the financial benefits. This ongoing royalty payment from their past work is one of the biggest advantages for artists in joining the digital art space."
